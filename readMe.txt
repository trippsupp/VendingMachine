Start by loading up the source files in your IDE (netBeans in my case). Build and run the program. The app will start and the first thing you will do is enter an amount of money for a product. Once you enter the money in the correct jTextField you press insert. The coins are inserted to the machine and you are then prompted to purchase an item. You will click the purchase button corresponding to the product you want. If the item is in stock and the correct amount of money is inserted, the user will be dispensed their product. Then the screen will update and the corresponding quantity will be deducted. At this time the money used to purchase the product is changed back to the user, if there is any. The machine will also store the amount required for each purchase in it's safe. When you want to withdraw money from the machine, simply click the withdraw button and type in how much you wish to withdraw (you can put as much as you want, but the max withdraw is the amount in the machine). Finally if you wish to restock an item click the restock button and enter the required information for the product number and amount of product you wish to restock (10 is the max for each product).
